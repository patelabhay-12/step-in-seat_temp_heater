Firstly the whole system monitored that the person is sitted or not on the chair of car and if it is detected then it is checked  the temperature sensor ON or not , when both conditions satisfy then heater turns on and operation starts upto the requirements.
The Seat Heating and Monitoring System is capable of maintaining the required heat for vehicle seats.In our project the button sensor checks whether the passenger is seated or not and after the passenger is seated the passenger have to set the temperature according to his/her requirement and then the seat starts heating and the corrsponding temperature is displayed on LCD.
#ACTIVITY 1- To turn ON the led when heater and button are pressed.
#Activity 2- To read the ADC value using potentiometer.
#Activity 3- To read the PWM output using CRO.


#CONCLUSION
In our project the main aim is to design and develop the system which is capable of monitoring the presence of the passenger and heat monitoring and displaying the corresponding value.
